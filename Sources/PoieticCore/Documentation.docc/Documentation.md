# ``PoieticCore``

Core library for creating applications for systems thinking and simulation.

## Overview

The Poietic Core is a library that provides functionality to iteratively
construct models of systems representable as graphs. One example of such models
is a Stock and Flow model, a causal map or a biochemical pathways map.

The core functionality is:

- Design, design objects and their history
- Metamodel - domain description
- Edge rules and model constraints
- Design data representation
- Simple querying
- Reading, writing, foreign interfaces and persistence (JSON included)
- Arithmetic expressions and functions

![Core Areas](core-modules)

The philosophy for applications on top of the library is:

- Treat user's input as holy.
- Allow user to experiment with a model design without worry.
- Assure sustainability, evolvability and repairability of the design data.

The core class of the model is the ``Design`` which contains and manages
all the design objects – ``DesignObject`` – and their changes in form of
design frames ``DesignFrame``.

Designs are typically a part of a problem domain, or follow a methodology. The
concepts and rules of the problem domain or a methodology or both are described
in a ``Metamodel`` associated with the design. More in [Metamodel and Types](doc:MetamodelAndTypes).

package for a concrete domain use-case of the core package.
