/// Object representing a built-in variable.
///
/// Each instance of this type represents a variable within a domain model. It
/// provides information about the variable such as description or expected
/// type.
///
/// Example built-in variables: `time`, `time_delta`, `previous_value`, â€¦
///
/// The instance does not represent the value of the variable.
///
/// There should be only one instance of the variable per concept within the
/// domain model. Therefore instances of built-in variables can be compared
/// with identity comparison operator (`===`).
///
public final class Variable: Hashable, Sendable {
    /// Name of the variable.
    ///
    /// The name of the variable is used in arithmetic expressions to refer
    /// to the variable.
    ///
    public let name: String
    
    /// Default value of the built-in variable.
    ///
    public let initialValue: Variant?
    
    /// Human-readable description of the variable.
    public let abstract: String?
    
    /// Data type of the variable value.
    ///
    public let valueType: ValueType
    
    /// Create a new built-in variable.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - name: Name of the variable
    ///     - value: Default value of the variable.
    ///     - valueType: Expected type of the value content.
    ///     - abstract: short human description of the variable.
