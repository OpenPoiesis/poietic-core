///
/// Component attributes can be retrieved and set by their name, using
/// ``InspectableComponent/attribute(forKey:)``
/// and ``InspectableComponent/setAttribute(value:forKey:)`` respectively.
/// This interface is for unified modification of the component attributes from
/// a foreign source, such as foreign data or a script.

/// Component attribute names share the same name-space within an object.
/// There must not be multiple components having an attribute with the same
/// name in an object.
