/// System scheduler is responsible for system registration, dependency ordering and running.
///
/// ## Use
///
/// Typically there is one scheduler per problem domain and even per application. For example,
/// a Stock and Flow simulation application would have just one system scheduler with systems
/// for expression parsing, flow dependency graph and computational model creation.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let scheduler = SystemScheduler()
///
/// scheduler.register(ExpressionParserSystem())
/// scheduler.register(ParametereDependecySystem())
/// scheduler.register(StockFlowAnalysisSystem())
///
/// let runtimeFrame = RuntimeFrame(validatedFrame)
/// try scheduler.execute(runtimeFrame)
/// ```
///
/// - Note: The concept of Systems in this library is for modelling and separation of concerns,
///         not for performance reasons.
///

    ///
    /// After registration, execution order is recomputed based on all
    /// registered systems and their dependencies.
    ///
    /// There can be only one system of given type. When registering a system of already registered
    /// system type, the old one will be discarded and the new one will be used.
